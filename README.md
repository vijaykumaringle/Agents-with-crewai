## üìù Repository Summary

The Agents-with-crewai repository is a comprehensive collection of AI agent implementations built using the CrewAI framework, designed to demonstrate various multi-agent AI use cases and collaborative capabilities. This repository contains **five main projects**, each showcasing different applications of AI agents working together to solve complex problems.

### **Key Projects Overview:**

1. **Cipher Agent** - A business intelligence agent that fetches Google reviews, performs sentiment analysis, extracts pros/cons, and generates business improvement plans. Features full CI/CD with GitHub Actions and comprehensive testing.

2. **Learning Assistant** - An AI-powered educational companion that creates personalized learning paths, curates resources, and generates practice exercises based on available study time and topics.

3. **Spark** - A business opportunity identifier that analyzes market trends, assesses competitive landscapes, and identifies potential business opportunities in specific markets.

4. **Agent123** - A foundational CrewAI template project that serves as a multi-agent system blueprint, featuring configurable agents and tasks for research and report generation.

### **Technical Architecture:**
- **Framework**: Built on CrewAI for multi-agent orchestration
- **Language**: 100% Python codebase
- **Dependencies**: Core dependencies include crewai>=0.1.0, pysbd, pytest, black, isort, and mypy
- **Structure**: Each project is self-contained with its own source code, requirements, documentation, and configuration files
- **Development**: Comprehensive testing infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and development tools for code quality

### **Repository Features:**
- **Modular Design**: Each agent project is independently deployable and configurable
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed README files for each project with setup and usage instructions  
- **Development Ready**: Virtual environment support, dependency management, and standardized project structure
- **Production Features**: GitHub Actions workflows, automated testing, and proper error handling
