### Week 1: Introduction to Quantum Physics Practice Exercises

Here are some practice exercises covering the history of quantum mechanics, wave-particle duality, and basic postulates, with varying difficulty levels:

**Easy:**

1.  **Multiple Choice:** Who is credited with introducing the concept of energy quantization?
    *   (a) Isaac Newton
    *   (b) Albert Einstein
    *   (c) Max Planck
    *   (d) Niels Bohr
    **Answer:** (c) Max Planck

2.  **True or False:** Wave-particle duality suggests that particles can exhibit wave-like properties and waves can exhibit particle-like properties.
    **Answer:** True

3.  **Fill in the Blank:** The principle that it is impossible to know both the position and momentum of a particle with perfect accuracy is known as the ______ principle.
    **Answer:** Heisenberg Uncertainty

**Medium:**

1.  **Short Explanation:** Explain the historical context that led to the development of quantum mechanics, mentioning at least two key experiments or observations.
    **Answer:**
    *   Blackbody radiation: Classical physics failed to explain the spectrum of light emitted by heated objects, leading Planck to propose energy quantization.
    *   Photoelectric effect: Einstein explained this by proposing that light consists of particles (photons), challenging the classical wave theory of light.

2.  **Problem:** A photon has a wavelength of 500 nm. Calculate its energy using the formula E = hc/λ, where h = 6.626 x 10^-34 J.s and c = 3 x 10^8 m/s.
    **Answer:** E = (6.626 x 10^-34 J.s * 3 x 10^8 m/s) / (500 x 10^-9 m) = 3.9756 x 10^-19 J

3.  **Concept Question:** Describe in your own words what wave-particle duality means. Give an example of experimental evidence supporting it.
    **Answer:** Wave-particle duality means that entities like photons and electrons can behave as both waves and particles, depending on the experiment. The double-slit experiment with electrons demonstrates this, showing an interference pattern (wave-like behavior) even when electrons are sent one at a time (particle-like behavior).

**Hard:**

1.  **Essay Question:** Discuss the philosophical implications of wave-particle duality and the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle on our understanding of the universe.
    **Answer:** Wave-particle duality challenges classical determinism by suggesting that the fundamental constituents of the universe do not have definite properties until measured. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle reinforces this by stating that there are inherent limits to what we can know, implying that the act of measurement fundamentally affects the system being measured.

2.  **Advanced Problem:** Using the de Broglie relation, calculate the wavelength of an electron moving at a velocity of 10^6 m/s. (Mass of electron = 9.109 x 10^-31 kg)
    **Answer:** λ = h / p = h / (mv) = (6.626 x 10^-34 J.s) / (9.109 x 10^-31 kg * 10^6 m/s) = 7.27 x 10^-10 m

3.  **Research and Explain:** Research and explain the significance of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics.
    **Answer:** The Copenhagen interpretation, primarily developed by Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg, is one of the earliest and most commonly taught interpretations of quantum mechanics. It posits that quantum systems do not have definite properties prior to measurement, and the act of measurement causes the wave function to collapse into a definite state. It also emphasizes the probabilistic nature of quantum predictions and the role of the observer in defining reality.
